description:
- A Functional requirement is a specific feature or behavior that a software system
  must possess to meet its intended purpose. It defines what the system is supposed
  to do and focuses on the functionality of the software. This artifact is different
  from other software artifacts, such as non-functional requirements, which focus
  on the quality attributes of the system, like performance, security, and usability.
example:
- The system shall allow users to create, edit, and delete their personal profiles,
  including their name, email address, and profile picture.
format:
- 'The system shall [action verb] [object] [condition or additional details], [optional:
  including/excluding specific elements or features].'
questions:
- - What is the overall purpose or goal of the system?
  - Who are the intended users of the system?
  - What key features or functions is the system intended to have?
  - What inputs does the system need to operate?
  - What outputs does the system produce?
  - What are the main components or modules of the system architecture?
  - How do the different components interact with each other?
  - What non-functional requirements like performance, security, etc. are important?
  - What constraints or assumptions exist in the operating environment?
  - What use cases or user stories would exercise the key functions?
