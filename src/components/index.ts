/**
 * # Vue Component Code Conventions.
 * - Exported components should have a comment describing them.
 * - "name" should match the file name.
 * - "methods" and "computed" functions should have comments describing them.
 * - Functions that are called by user interaction should be prefixed with "handle".
 * - Whenever possible, if statements should not increase the indent depth.
 * - Return types that are easily implied do not need to be explicit.
