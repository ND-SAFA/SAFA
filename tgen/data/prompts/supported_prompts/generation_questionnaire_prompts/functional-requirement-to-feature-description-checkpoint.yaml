description:
- A Feature description is a concise and clear explanation of a specific functionality
  or aspect of a software development project. It is an essential artifact that helps
  stakeholders understand the purpose, scope, and requirements of a particular feature.
  This artifact is different from other software artifacts, such as user stories or
  use cases, as it focuses on the high-level overview of the feature, its benefits,
  and its interactions with other components of the system, rather than detailing
  the step-by-step process or user interactions.
example:
- 'Feature: Export Data to CSV


  Description: The Export Data to CSV feature allows users to download a CSV file
  containing the data displayed in the application''s data table. This feature enables
  users to easily manipulate and analyze the data using external tools, such as spreadsheet
  software.


  Requirements:

  - The user must be able to select the data they want to export.

  - The exported CSV file must include all columns displayed in the data table.

  - The CSV file must be formatted according to the RFC 4180 standard.

  - The user must be able to choose the location where the CSV file will be saved.


  Dependencies:

  Acceptance Criteria:

  - The user can successfully export the selected data to a CSV file.

  - The CSV file contains the correct data and formatting.

  - The user can open the CSV file in a spreadsheet software without any issues.'
format:
- 'Feature: [Feature Name]  Description: [A brief description of the feature and its
  purpose]  Requirements: - [List of requirements for the feature]  Dependencies:
  - [List of components or features that this feature depends on]  Acceptance Criteria:
  - [List of criteria that must be met for the feature to be considered complete]'
questions:
- - What is the overall purpose or goal of the system?
  - Who are the users or actors that will interact with the system?
  - What are the key functions or capabilities the system needs to have?
  - Are there any constraints or limitations that impact the design?
  - What are the main inputs and outputs for each function?
  - What data or information does the system need to store or access?
  - What external systems or interfaces does it need to connect to?
  - Are there any non-functional requirements like performance, security, etc?
  - What are the different ways users will interact with the system?
  - What are the key workflows or use cases the system needs to support?
