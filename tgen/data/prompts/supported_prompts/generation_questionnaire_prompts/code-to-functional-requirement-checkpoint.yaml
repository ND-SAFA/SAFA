description:
- A Functional requirement is a specific feature or functionality that a software
  system must possess to meet its intended purpose. It defines the expected behavior
  of the system and focuses on what the system is supposed to do. This artifact is
  different from other software artifacts, such as non-functional requirements, which
  focus on how well the system performs its functions, rather than the functions themselves.
example:
- 'For an online shopping platform, a Functional requirement could be: "The system
  shall allow users to add items to their shopping cart, view the contents of the
  cart, and remove items from the cart."'
format:
- '"The system shall [action verb] [object] [condition or additional details]."'
questions:
- - What are the main functions or methods in the code?
  - What are the inputs and outputs of these functions?
  - What data structures are used and manipulated by the code?
  - Are there any major algorithms implemented in the code?
  - Does the code interact with any external systems or devices?
  - Are there any configurations or settings initialized when the code starts up?
  - Does the code have any logging or outputs that give insight into its behavior?
  - Are there any obvious features or use cases that can be inferred from method names
    or comments?
  - Does the code base include any tests or specs that demonstrate intended functionality?
  - What exceptions or error conditions are handled by the code?
