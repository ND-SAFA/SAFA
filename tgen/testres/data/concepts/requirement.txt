The GS Antenna System includes a set of antenna stations. The term GS antenna station is defined as:

a) the antenna structure, including reflector, axis gears and drives, pedestal, and equipment shelter and enclosure(s);
b) feeds and sub-reflector(s);
c) the receive path to the IFDS;
d) the transmit path from the IFDS to the antenna reflector;
e) a frequency translator;
f) monitoring and control;
g) cableway(s) and cables, including cabling between the shelter and site operations building;
h) power to pads from operations building interface;
i) grounding and lightning protection;
j) pad and service area, and road extension to pad;
k) security fence and locks;
l) antenna station lighting and security lighting;
m) operational safety video surveillance capability.

It is intended that the GS Antenna System will be used to reliably transmit command and data signals to, and receive telemetry and rebroadcast data from, GOES-R and GOES-N satellites, while integrating with the Ground Segment at all three sites. (CCR01530)
