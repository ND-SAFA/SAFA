- An Epic title in a software development project is a high-level, broad description
  of a large feature or functionality that needs to be implemented. It is a collection
  of smaller, related user stories or tasks that together deliver a significant value
  to the end-user. An Epic title is different from other software artifacts, such
  as user stories or tasks, as it represents a larger scope and usually takes multiple
  sprints to complete.

- Implement Advanced Search Functionality
