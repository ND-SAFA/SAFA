description:
- A Design requirement is a specific and detailed description of a feature or functionality
  that a software development project must include to meet its objectives. It is an
  artifact that focuses on the design aspects of the software, such as user interface,
  architecture, and interaction between components. This differentiates it from other
  software artifacts like functional requirements, which focus on what the software
  should do, and non-functional requirements, which focus on how well the software
  should perform.
example:
- 'Design Requirement: The user interface of the web application should include a
  responsive navigation menu that adapts to different screen sizes and devices. On
  desktop screens, the menu should be displayed horizontally at the top of the page,
  with dropdown submenus for each main menu item. On mobile devices, the menu should
  be collapsed into a "hamburger" icon, which, when tapped, expands to display the
  full menu vertically with collapsible submenus for each main menu item.'
format:
- 'Design Requirement: The system shall [describe the feature or functionality in
  detail, including any technical specifications, standards, or protocols that must
  be followed]. The [feature or functionality] shall [list any specific requirements,
  such as supported operations, data formats, or security measures].'
questions:
- - What are the main functions/classes in the code?
  - What are the key inputs and outputs of these functions/classes?
  - How do the different functions/classes interact with each other?
  - Is there a clear separation of concerns in the code structure?
  - What are the main data structures used in the code?
  - Does the code follow common design patterns? If so, which ones?
  - What are the dependencies between different modules/packages?
  - Does the code have clear error handling and logging?
  - Is there evidence of security considerations in the code?
  - What are the key algorithms implemented in the code?
