description:
- A User story is a concise, informal description of a software feature or functionality,
  written from the perspective of the end user. It is a key artifact in Agile software
  development, used to capture and prioritize requirements. User stories differ from
  other software artifacts, such as use cases or functional specifications, in that
  they are intentionally brief, focusing on the user's needs and goals, and are typically
  written in everyday language. They are meant to foster collaboration and communication
  between the development team and stakeholders, rather than serving as a detailed
  technical specification.
example:
- As a frequent traveler, I want to be able to filter hotel search results by distance
  from a specific landmark, so that I can find accommodations close to my desired
  location.
format:
- As a [type of user], I want to [action or goal] so that [reason or benefit].
questions:
- - What are the main classes/functions in the code?
  - What are the inputs and outputs of the main functions?
  - Is there any user interface code and what does it do?
  - Is there any database or file access code and what does it access?
  - Are there any configuration or settings files and what do they configure?
  - Is there logging or error handling code and what does it log/handle?
  - Does the code appear to follow an MVC or layered architecture pattern?
  - What external services, APIs, or libraries does the code use and why?
  - What algorithms or business logic can be inferred from the code?
  - What user needs might the code address based on its capabilities?
