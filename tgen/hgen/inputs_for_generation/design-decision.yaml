description:
- A Design Decision in a software development project is a formalized, documented
  choice made during the design phase of a project that addresses a significant aspect
  of the system's architecture, functionality, or behavior. It is different from other
  software artifacts as it not only describes the chosen solution but also the context,
  the considered alternatives, and the reasons for the selection. It is a crucial
  part of the software documentation that helps in understanding the rationale behind
  certain design aspects, facilitates knowledge transfer, and aids in future decision-making
  processes.
example:
- '

  Title: Choice of Database Management System (DBMS)

  Context: The project requires a DBMS to manage and store data. The choice of DBMS
  will significantly impact the performance, scalability, and security of the system.

  Alternatives Considered: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB

  Decision: PostgreSQL was chosen as the DBMS for the project.

  Rationale: PostgreSQL offers robust performance, high compliance with SQL standards,
  and extensive support for advanced data types and functions. It also provides strong
  security features and scalability, which are crucial for the project. While MySQL
  is also a strong contender, it lacks some of the advanced features provided by PostgreSQL.
  MongoDB, being a NoSQL database, does not fit the relational data model required
  for the project.

  Implications: The team needs to be familiar with PostgreSQL and its features. The
  system needs to be designed to leverage the capabilities of PostgreSQL.

format:
- 'Context: [Describe the situation or problem that requires a decision.]

  Alternatives Considered: [List the different options that were considered to address
  the problem.]

  Decision: [State the chosen solution.]

  Rationale: [Explain why this solution was chosen over the others, detailing the
  advantages and benefits it offers.]

  Implications: [Discuss the consequences or effects of this decision on the project,
  including any changes or actions that need to be taken.]'
questions:
- - What are the main components/modules in the code and how are they organized?
  - What are the key classes/functions and what are their responsibilities?
  - How is the data modeled and passed between components?
  - What are the key algorithms/logic used throughout the code?
  - What design patterns are used, if any?
  - What are the main control flows through the system?
  - How extensible is the code? Are there abstraction layers, interfaces, etc?
  - What are the dependencies between components/modules?
  - How is concurrency handled?
  - What are the key configuration/initialization steps?
