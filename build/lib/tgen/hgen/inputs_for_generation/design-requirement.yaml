description:
- A Design requirement is a specific and detailed description of a feature or functionality
  that a software development project must include to meet its objectives. It is an
  artifact that focuses on the design aspects of the software, such as user interface,
  architecture, and interaction between components. This differentiates it from other
  software artifacts like functional requirements, which focus on what the software
  should do, and non-functional requirements, which focus on how well the software
  should perform.
example:
- 'Design Requirement: The user interface of the web application should include a
  responsive navigation menu that adapts to different screen sizes and devices. On
  desktop screens, the menu should be displayed horizontally at the top of the page,
  with dropdown submenus for each main menu item. On mobile devices, the menu should
  be collapsed into a "hamburger" icon, which, when tapped, expands to display the
  full menu vertically with collapsible submenus for each main menu item.'
format:
- '[Brief description of the feature or functionality]: [Detailed
  description of the design aspect, including user interface, architecture, or interaction
  between components]. [Additional specifications or constraints, if applicable].'
questions:
- - What are the main functions/classes in the code?
  - What are the key inputs and outputs of these functions/classes?
  - What are the main data structures used in the code?
  - What are the key algorithms implemented in the code?
  - Are there any major modules/components that can be identified?
  - What are the relationships and interactions between the main modules/components?
  - What are the key control flows in the code?
  - Are there any configuration files or external dependencies?
  - Are there any hardware/platform specific code sections?
  - What are the main use cases or features enabled by the code?
