- A Feature-based user story is a high-level description of a software feature or
  functionality, written from the perspective of the end user. It focuses on the value
  the feature provides to the user and helps the development team understand the user's
  needs and expectations. This artifact is different from other software artifacts,
  such as use cases or requirements, as it is more focused on the user experience
  and is typically written in a simple, non-technical language.
example:
- As a frequent traveler, I want to be able to filter hotel search results by distance
  from a specific location, so that I can find hotels that are conveniently located
  near my desired destination.
format:
- As a [type of user], I want to [action or feature], so that [reason or benefit].
questions:
- - What are the main classes/files in the codebase and what is their purpose?
  - Is there a clear architecture like MVC or layered architecture? What are the components?
  - What are the key functions/methods that indicate the main features of the system?
  - Is there any configuration or external dependencies that would affect features?
  - Are there any obvious entry points like a main method or REST endpoints that drive
    the features?
  - What are the main data structures and how are they used in features?
  - Are there any special algorithms or complex logic that would map to specific features?
  - Are there any UI or front-end files that indicate user-facing features?
  - Are there automated tests or specs that describe intended functionality?
  - What external resources like databases or files are accessed that enable features?
