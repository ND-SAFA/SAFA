description:
- A System Requirement is a formal statement of the needs and expectations of a software
  development project, describing the essential capabilities, performance, and characteristics
  of the system to be developed. It is a high-level, comprehensive description of
  the system's functionality, constraints, and attributes, which differentiates it
  from other software artifacts like use cases, user stories, or functional requirements
  that focus on specific aspects or interactions within the system.
example:
- 'System Requirement: The software shall provide a secure user authentication system,
  allowing users to create unique accounts with a username and password. The system
  must enforce password complexity requirements, including a minimum length of 8 characters,
  at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one special
  character. The authentication system should also support password recovery through
  a secure email-based process.'
format:
- 'System Requirement: The software shall [provide/enable/support] [a specific feature
  or functionality], [detailing the key aspects, constraints, or attributes of the
  feature or functionality]. [Additional requirements or specifications related to
  the feature or functionality, if necessary].'
