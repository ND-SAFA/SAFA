- A Functional Requirement is a specific and well-defined feature or functionality
  that a software system must possess to meet its intended purpose. It describes what
  the system is supposed to do and focuses on the expected behavior of the software.
  This artifact is different from other software artifacts, such as non-functional
  requirements, which focus on the quality attributes of the system, like performance,
  security, and usability.
example:
- As a user, I should be able to create an account by providing my email address,
  a unique username, and a password. The system must verify the email address and
  ensure the username is not already taken. Upon successful registration, the user
  should receive a confirmation email.
format:
- As a [user role], I should be able to [action] by [input or interaction]. The system
  must [system behavior or validation]. [Additional conditions or expected outcomes].
