description:
  - An Epic in a software development project is a large, high-level user story that
    encompasses a significant feature or functionality. It is typically too big to be
    completed in a single iteration and needs to be broken down into smaller, more manageable
    user stories. An Epic is different from other software artifacts, such as tasks
    or bugs, as it represents a broader scope and provides a strategic overview of the
    desired outcome, rather than focusing on specific technical details or issues.
