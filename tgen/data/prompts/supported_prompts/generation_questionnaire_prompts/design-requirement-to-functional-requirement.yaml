description:
- A Functional requirement is a specific feature or functionality that a software
  system must possess to meet its intended purpose. It describes the expected behavior
  of the system and focuses on what the system is supposed to do. This artifact is
  different from other software artifacts, such as non-functional requirements, which
  focus on how well the system performs its functions, rather than the functions themselves.
example:
- 'For an online shopping platform, a Functional requirement could be: "The system
  shall allow users to add items to their shopping cart, view the contents of the
  cart, and remove items from the cart."'
format:
- '"The system shall [action verb] [object] [condition or additional details]."'
questions:
- - What is the overall purpose or goal of the system?
  - Who are the intended users of the system?
  - What are the key features and capabilities that the design aims to provide?
  - What inputs does the system require?
  - What outputs does the system produce?
  - What are the main components and how do they interact?
  - Are there any constraints or assumptions in the design?
  - What non-functional requirements like performance, security, etc. are considered?
  - What use cases or user workflows is the system intended to support?
  - What external systems or data sources does the design interact with?
