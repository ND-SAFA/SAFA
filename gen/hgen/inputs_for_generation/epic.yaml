description:
- An Epic in a software development project is a large, high-level user story that
  encompasses a significant feature or functionality. It is typically too big to be
  completed in a single iteration and needs to be broken down into smaller, more manageable
  user stories. An Epic is different from other software artifacts, such as tasks
  or bugs, as it represents a broader scope and provides a strategic overview of the
  desired outcome, rather than focusing on specific details or technical implementation.
example:
- 'Epic: Improve User Onboarding Experience


  As a new user, I want to have a seamless onboarding experience, so that I can quickly
  understand the value of the product and start using it effectively.


  - Create an interactive tutorial for first-time users

  - Implement a progress bar to show onboarding steps

  - Design a series of tooltips to guide users through key features

  - Develop a "Getting Started" guide with video tutorials and FAQs

  - Add a chatbot for instant support during the onboarding process'
format:
- 'Epic: [Epic Title]  As a [user role], I want to [goal], so that [reason].  - [User
  story or task 1] - [User story or task 2] - [User story or task 3] - [User story
  or task 4] - [User story or task 5]'

- - What is the goal or objective of this user story?
  - Who is the user or persona that will benefit from this user story?
  - What value does this user story provide to the user?

  - What other related user stories exist that could be grouped into an epic with

  - What part of the overall product vision or roadmap does this user story align

  - Is this user story independent or does it rely on other stories being completed
    first?
  - What are the acceptance criteria that define the scope and done-ness of this story?
  - What dependencies exist that could impact the implementation of this story?
  - What is the relative priority or importance of delivering this user story?
