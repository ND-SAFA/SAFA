# Entities\n\n\nArtifact: Software component like document, code module,
   or model managed in the system\nProject: Collection of artifacts that forms a\
   software project\nUser: Person interacting with the system to manage artifacts\
   \nPermission: Access level that determines what a user can do within a project\n\
  Version: Specific iteration of a project's artifacts\nTrace Link: Relationship between\
   two artifacts that models traceability\nTrace Model: Graph of all trace links\
   between artifacts in a project\nSummary: Condensed overview and key points extracted\
   from an artifact\nWarning: Issue detected with an artifact based on validation\
   rules\nWarning Rule: Criteria for identifying an issue with an artifact\n\n\n\
  # \nKey System Capabilities for Managing Software Artifacts\n\n\nThe software system\
   provides extensive capabilities for users to create, organize, and manage software\
   artifacts. Artifacts represent documents, code, models, and other software components,
   containing attributes like name, type, content body, summary, associated documents,
   and custom fields. Artifacts can be linked together into traceability relationships\
   that model dependencies between components. \n\nArtifacts are organized within\
   software projects, which group related artifacts and provide access permissions\
   to users. Projects also contain versions to manage changes to artifacts over time.
   Users can initialize new projects by uploading existing files, which are processed\
   into artifact records.\n\nThe system assists users by extracting entities from\
   artifact content using natural language processing techniques. It can also auto-generate\
   summaries of artifact content to provide overviews. Additionally, the system identifies\
   issues and warnings with artifacts based on configurable validation rules.\n\n\
  The system provides specialized interfaces to support common artifact management\
   tasks. These include interfaces for creating projects, uploading artifact files,
   viewing and inspecting artifact details, editing artifact metadata and content,
   linking artifacts to model traceability, and deleting artifacts. \n\nOverall,
   the system focuses on providing robust capabilities for users to create, organize,
   analyze, and manage software artifacts within the context of projects and traceability\
   models. The functional requirements will build upon these key system capabilities\
   related to artifact and project management.
