description:
- A Functional Constraint is a specific limitation or restriction imposed on a software
  development project that affects the functionality or behavior of the system. It
  is different from other software artifacts, such as requirements or specifications,
  as it focuses on the constraints or boundaries within which the system must operate,
  rather than defining the desired features or capabilities of the system.
example:
- 'Functional Constraint: The file upload feature of the web application must support
  a maximum file size of 10 MB, and the system must not allow users to upload files
  larger than this limit.'
format:
- 'Functional Constraint: [Description of the constraint on a specific feature or
  functionality of the system, including any limitations or restrictions that must
  be adhered to during development.]'
