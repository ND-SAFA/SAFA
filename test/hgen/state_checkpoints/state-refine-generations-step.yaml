  ? As a game developer, I want a Player class to store player state, apply movement,
    handle collisions, perform raycasting for block selection, and render the player,
    so that I can implement a controllable character that interacts with the 3D world.

  ? As a game developer, I want a RenderEngine class to handle window creation, OpenGL
    context, camera view, and scene rendering, so that I have a reusable graphics
    engine for displaying 3D scenes.
  : - /Rendering/RenderEngine.cpp
  ? As a game developer, I want an Image class to load image files as textures using
    STB Image, so that I can apply detailed textures to 3D models.

  \ Capabilities for Managing Software Artifacts\\n\\n\\nThe software system\\\n \
  \  provides extensive capabilities for users to create, organize, and manage software\\\
  \n   artifacts. Artifacts represent documents, code, models, and other software\
  \ components,\n   containing attributes like name, type, content body, summary,\
  \ associated documents,\n   and custom fields. Artifacts can be linked together\
  \ into traceability relationships\\\n   that model dependencies between components.\
  \ \\n\\nArtifacts are organized within\\\n   software projects, which group related\
  \ artifacts and provide access permissions\\\n   to users. Projects also contain\
  \ versions to manage changes to artifacts over time.\n   Users can initialize new\
  \ projects by uploading existing files, which are processed\\\n   into artifact\
  \ records.\\n\\nThe system assists users by extracting entities from\\\n   artifact\
  \ content using natural language processing techniques. It can also auto-generate\\\
  \n   summaries of artifact content to provide overviews. Additionally, the system\
  \ identifies\\\n   issues and warnings with artifacts based on configurable validation\
  \ rules.\\n\\n\\\n  The system provides specialized interfaces to support common\
  \ artifact management\\\n   tasks. These include interfaces for creating projects,\
  \ uploading artifact files,\n   viewing and inspecting artifact details, editing\
  \ artifact metadata and content,\n   linking artifacts to model traceability, and\
  \ deleting artifacts. \\n\\nOverall,\n   the system focuses on providing robust\
  \ capabilities for users to create, organize,\n   analyze, and manage software artifacts\
  \ within the context of projects and traceability\\\n   models. The functional requirements\
  \ will build upon these key system capabilities\\\n   related to artifact and project\
  \ management.\n"
