step:
- deliverable:
  - A high-level overview of the system architecture and functionality.
  instructions:
  - Analyze the code to identify the main components and functions of the system.
    Group related components and functions together into logical modules. Document
    the purpose and responsibilities of each module.
  name:
  - Module
- deliverable:
  - A description of the logical flow and purpose of each function and variable within
    the modules.
  instructions:
  - Within each module, analyze the code to identify the inputs, outputs, and purpose
    of each function. Document function signatures, parameters, and return values.
    Identify any global variables used and their purpose.
  name:
  - Flow
- deliverable:
  - A high-level overview of how the modules and functions work together to achieve
    the overall system functionality.
  instructions:
  - Analyze the relationships and interactions between modules and functions to understand
    the overall program flow and logic.  Identify any dependencies or sequencing requirements
    between modules and functions.
  name:
  - Logic
- deliverable:
  - A set of requirements describing what the system does to satisfy user and system
    needs.
  instructions:
  - Review the information gathered in the previous steps. Identify and document the
    key requirements, capabilities, and constraints of the system based on how the
    code implements functionality. Organize the requirements by module and function
    where applicable. Ensure each requirement is uniquely identified and testable.
