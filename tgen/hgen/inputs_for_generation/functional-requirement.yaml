description:
- A Functional requirement is a specific feature or functionality that a software
  system must possess to meet its intended purpose. It describes the expected behavior
  of the system and focuses on what the system is supposed to do. This artifact is
  different from other software artifacts, such as non-functional requirements, which
  focus on how well the system performs its functions, rather than the functions themselves.
example:
- 'For an online shopping platform, a Functional requirement could be: "The system
  shall allow users to add items to their shopping cart, view the contents of the
  cart, and modify the quantity of items in the cart before proceeding to checkout."'
format:
- '"The system shall [action verb] [object] to [purpose or outcome].
 [additional details or conditions]"'
questions:
- - What are the main functions or methods in the code?
  - What are the inputs and outputs of these main functions?
  - What data structures are used to store and manipulate data?
  - Are there any key algorithms implemented in the code?
  - Are there any important utility or helper functions?
  - Does the code interact with any external systems or APIs?
  - Are there any configuration files that provide insight into the system?
  - Are there any logging or debugging statements that provide clues?
  - What are the main control flows and execution paths?
  - What are the key variables and data that persist across function calls?
