  - A DB Entity Spec, or Database Entity Specification, in a software development project
    is a detailed description of the data entities that are part of a database system.
    It outlines the attributes, relationships, and constraints of each entity. This
    artifact is different from others as it specifically focuses on the data layer of
    the software, providing a clear understanding of how data is structured, stored,
    and related. It serves as a blueprint for database design and implementation, and
    is crucial for ensuring data integrity and consistency.
example:
  - '

  Entity Name: Customer


  Attributes:

  - CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer (Primary Key)

  - FirstName: First name of the customer (String, Not Null)

  - LastName: Last name of the customer (String, Not Null)

  - Email: Email address of the customer (String, Unique, Not Null)

  - PhoneNumber: Contact number of the customer (String, Not Null)


  Relationships:

  - One-to-Many relationship with Orders: A customer can place multiple orders, but
  each order is associated with one customer.


  Constraints:

  - Email must be unique: No two customers can have the same email address.

  - CustomerID, FirstName, LastName, Email, and PhoneNumber cannot be null: These
  are mandatory fields for each customer record.

format:
  - "\nEntity Name: [Entity Name]
  \nDescription: [Entity Description]
  \n- Attributes:

  \n\t\t * Type: [Data Type]
  \n\t\t * Description: [Description of the attribute.] "
questions:
  - - What are the main classes or data structures representing entities in the code?
    - What are the properties or fields of those classes that would map to attributes
      in a database table?
    - What are the primary keys that uniquely identify each instance of those classes?
    - What are the relationships between the different classes based on references,
      foreign keys, etc?
    - Are there any inheritance hierarchies between classes that would inform a database
      schema?
    - What are the data types of each property or field in the classes?
    - Are there any validation rules, constraints, or restrictions on the values of
      certain properties?
    - Are there any indexes defined on certain properties for performance reasons?
    - Are there any timestamps or metadata properties like created/updated dates?
    - Are there any properties that contain large amounts of text or binary data?
