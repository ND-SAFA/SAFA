description:
- A User story is a concise, informal description of a software feature or functionality,
  written from the perspective of the end user. It is a key artifact in Agile software
  development, used to capture and prioritize requirements. User stories differ from
  other software artifacts, such as use cases or functional specifications, in that
  they are intentionally brief, focusing on the user's needs and goals, rather than
  providing detailed technical specifications.
example:
- As a frequent traveler, I want to be able to filter hotel search results by distance
  from a specific landmark, so that I can find accommodations close to my desired
  location.
format:
- As a [type of user], I want to [desired action or functionality], so that [reason
  or benefit].
questions:
- - What are the main classes/functions in the code?
  - What are the inputs and outputs of the main functions?
  - Is there any user interface code? If so, what can the user do?
  - Is there any persistence/database code? If so, what data is being stored?
  - Are there any external services being called? If so, what are they and why?
  - Is there any business logic code? If so, what rules is it implementing?
  - Are there any configurations/settings? If so, what can be configured?
  - Is there logging or analytics code? If so, what events are being tracked?
  - Is there any authentication/authorization code? If so, what roles exist?
  - What are the main code flows when the app starts up and when a user takes an action?
