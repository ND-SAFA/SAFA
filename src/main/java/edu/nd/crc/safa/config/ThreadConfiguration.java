     * To summarize: thread pools reuse threads (that's the whole point), but the security context is only copied
     * to the thread when it is first spawned. This means that subsequent jobs using that thread will use the old
     * context, which is likely to have been created for a different user. This creates instances where one user may
     * have access to parts of another user's account, if the request made for that object happened to be handled
     * from within the thread pool.
     * <br /><br />
     * Instead, the user's information needs to be retrieved in the thread that was originally handling the request
     * and then passed to the thread doing the background task.
