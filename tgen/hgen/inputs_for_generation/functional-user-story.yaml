- A Functional user story is a concise, informal description of a specific feature
  or functionality in a software development project. It focuses on the user's perspective
  and their interaction with the system, outlining the desired outcome or value they
  expect to receive. This artifact is different from other software artifacts, such
  as use cases or requirements, as it emphasizes the user's needs and goals rather
  than the technical details or implementation.
example:
- As a user, I want to be able to filter the list of available products by category
  so that I can easily find the products I am interested in.
format:
- As a [user role], I want to [action or feature] so that [desired outcome or value].
questions:
- - What are the main classes/functions in the code?
  - What are the inputs and outputs of the main functions?
  - Is there any user interface code and if so what does it do?
  - Is there any database or file access code and if so what does it do?
  - Are there any important algorithms or logic implemented in the code?
  - Does the code handle any events or user interactions?
  - What external services, APIs or libraries does the code use?
  - Are there any configurations or settings loaded/saved?
  - Is there logging or error handling code?
  - What are the dependencies between components in the code?
