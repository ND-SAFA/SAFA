description:
- A Feature in a software development project refers to a distinct functionality or
  behavior that the software is expected to perform. It is a high-level requirement
  that provides value to the end user. Unlike other software artifacts such as user
  stories or tasks, a Feature is broader in scope and often encompasses multiple user
  stories or tasks. It is a significant piece of functionality that is coherent and
  useful in its own right. Features are often used in planning and discussing the
  product at a high level, often with stakeholders.
example:
- 'A feature for an online shopping application could be: "As a user, I want to be
  able to search for products by name, description, or category so that I can easily
  find what I''m looking for."'
format:
- 'The typical format for a software development Feature includes:

  - The role of the user or system: "As a [type of user/system]"

  - The action or functionality that the user or system wants to perform: "I want
  to [action/functionality]"

  - The benefit or reason for the action or functionality: "so that [benefit/reason]"'
questions:
- - What are the main classes/functions in the code?
  - What are the key data structures used?
  - What are the main inputs and outputs of the functions?
  - Is there any configuration or initialization code?
  - Are there any important utility or helper functions?
  - What are the parameters to the main functions?
  - Are there any important algorithms implemented?
  - Is there logging or debugging code?
  - Are there any important constants or global variables?
  - What are the dependencies or external libraries used?
